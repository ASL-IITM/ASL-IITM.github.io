Extending this design into a full glove with series elastic actuation will allow us to create an exoskeleton glove that could assist patients in performing a wide variety of grasps. The final goal of this research at the Autonomous Systems Lab at IIT Madras, will be to deliver a viable product that could assist with the everyday challenges faced by patients in India.  |

This research explores development of safe techniques to recycle expended battery packs through the use of robotics and automation. Laboratory-level integrated system consisting of a UR5 robotic manipulator, gripper, vision system, and associated software will be developed to work alongside a with a human operator in a shared workspace. |

__Cooperative manipulation and transportation using Mobile robots:__ Over the recent years, robotic systems have been deployed extensively for manipulation and transportation tasks in warehouses. But majority of these applications involve a single robot interacting with an object in a given instant. This in turn limits the size and weight of the object involved in the task. The solution would be to use multi-robot cooperative manipulation and transportation strategy. This research aims to address the cooperative manipulation and transportation of an object, in the presence of static obstacles, using mobile robots. |
