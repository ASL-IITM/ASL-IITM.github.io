Extending this design into a full glove with series elastic actuation will allow us to create an exoskeleton glove that could assist patients in performing a wide variety of grasps. The final goal of this research at the Robotics and Mechatronics Lab at IIT Madras, will be to deliver a viable product that could assist with the everyday challenges faced by patients in India.  |
