We also explore the application of intelligent grasping and manipulation for practical applications such as human-robot collaborative workspace. This project is funded by the Accenture â€“ IIT Madras Centre of Excellence. |

This includes localization of indoor mobile robots in GPS denied environment, path planning in human centric environments as well. This project is funded by the New Faculty Initiation Grant (NFIG) from IIT Madras. |

But majority of these applications involve a single robot interacting with an object in a given instant. This in turn limits the size and weight of the object that can be handled. Multi-agent systems provide a natural solution in this scenario. This project is funded by the Start-up Research Grant (SRG) under Science & Engineering Research Board (SERB).|

Extending this design into a full glove with series elastic actuation will allow us to create an exoskeleton glove that could assist patients in performing a wide variety of grasps. The final goal of this research at the Autonomous Systems Lab at IIT Madras, will be to deliver a viable product that could assist with the everyday challenges faced by patients in India. This project is funded by the New Faculty Initiation Grant (NFIG) from IIT Madras. |
