### Motivation
Lithium-ion batteries have been around for a very long time and are still the preferred choice for most electronic devices. When compared to lithium polymer batteries, Lithium-ion offers longer lifespan, high energy density, and is relatively more affordable. In India, lithium-ion batteries are frequently employed in electric vehicles (EV) and energy storage systems (ESS) for laptops, mobile devices, grid power storage, etc. Of these, portable devices make up more than 50% of the total market share. The automobile sector now has the third largest market share, but this is projected to rise as EVs gain popularity.

In this context, battery recycling/reusability becomes a very important aspect. Safe battery disassembly which is a crucial first step towards battery reusability is currently done manually. This could lead to a high chance of accidents as well as health hazards to the personnel involved. Moreover manual disassembly  and does not scale well with the large volume of batteries that need to be recycled. This brings up the need for automating the process of battery disassembly. 


### Research goal
Ongoing research at the Autonomous Systems Lab is aimed at creating a laboratory-level integrated system capable of performing complete disassembly of a standard Li-ion battery pack alongside a human operator through a huma-robot collaborative approach. This involves developing a laboratory-level integrated system consisting of a robotic manipulator, gripper, vision system, and associated software.

While this research is focussed towards battery huma-robot collaborative disassembly of batteries, we expect that the technology developed under this research could be applied to advance the robotic assembly of products as well.
